# photon-boardroom-beacon
The boardroom beacon is a physical device mounted to the exterior wall of a boardroom. It has 3 lights indicating meeting room availability in half hour allotments. The first light indicates the boardroom status for the current half hour, the second indicates the next half hour and the third, the half hour after that. So any casual observer can see what the boardroom’s status is, for the next hour and a half. Statuses include “available” (green), “booked” (red) and “illegal” (yellow). An illegal status indicates that a person is in the room but it is not booked. Malfunction will be indicated by all three lights flashing yellow.
